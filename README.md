## Purpose
The data decribes the weather conditions in Hawaii in the months of June and December. The weather data supports setting up a year round ice cream and surf shop business.

## Results

### The best time for a surf shop
The data supports a surf shop operating in the month of December. The best surfing in Hawaii is between the months of November and Feburary when there are more storms in that area of the Pacific.  December has:

1. Higher average rainfall compared to June.
2. December also exhibits a greater chance for larger storms as evidenced by the higher standard deviation of rainfall
3. Lower average temperatures.

### The best time for an ice cream shop
Less unsettled weather means that during the summer months the surf will not be as good. During this period an ice cream shop would bring in much needed revenue to offset the lower revenue from the surfing business. The follow data supports an ice cream shop:

1. Higher average temperature in June compared to December
2. Lower standard deviation of temperature in June
3. Lower chance for percipitation.

## Conclusion

Hawaii's weather makes the surf and ice cream shop a good year round business. During the winter less ice cream will be sold because of the lower average temperatures and higher percipitation. Contrast that with the summer where there will be lower revenue from the surf business and higher revenue from the ice cream business as people look for a cool treat to escape the Island's hot weather.
